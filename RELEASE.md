# Release cheatsheet

The CI handles most of the release process. All that is required is pushing a tag in the form of `v{semver}`. Where
`{semver}` is a semantic version (e.g. `0.1.3`). This may include a pre-release part (e.g. `0.1.3-alpha.1`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CI will check if the version of the tag matches the version of the crates. If they don't align, the release build
> will fail. See below for more information.

## What we promise

Right now everything is in flux. We do not make any promises on the API (internal Rust APIs or external HTTP APIs).

We simply release `0.x` versions as we see fit. And it is ok to directly go from an `alpha` pre-release to a proper
release. We don't honor the semver promises (sorry).

Right now, we use the following pre-release modifiers (this might change in the future):

* `alpha` â€“ for any pre-release
* `rc` â€“ for something we plan to properly release

We also don't publish to crates.io, only release a tag, binary artifacts and container images.

For `1.0.0` and beyond, this should work differently. Maybe even before. However, there are no plans for that yet.

## Pre-requisites

* You have some common developer tools for Rust installed (e.g. `cargo`, `git`)
* Your local `main` branch is in sync with the upstream `main` branch. The git remote for upstream is named `upstream`.
* You have `cargo release` installed. This can be done using `cargo install cargo-release`.

## Performing the release

In a nutshell, the steps are:

* Ensure the cargo versions are aligned with the release tag that we create next
* Re-generate the OpenAPI spec, as it contains the version
* Tag the release
* Push the tag

To make it clearer what got released and what is part of the next release, it makes sense to create a PR *before*
pushing the release tag. This will also make step 1 easier for the *next* release, as that's already been taken care of.

The following instructions walk you through the process on the example of releasing `0.0.0-alpha.1`, which you need
to replace with the actual release. Note that during release process we should avoid merging any other PRs to main branch.


### 1. Prepare Branch 

Switch to main branch and make sure your local checkout is up-to-date.
```shell
> git switch main
> git fetch --all
> git rebase upstream/main
```

Checkout branch to prepare release from.
```shell
> git checkout -b 0.0.0-alpha.1-prepare
```

_Note - This is not a release branch!_

### 2. Create Pull Request

Dry run to check that we can safely bump release.
```shell
> cargo release version 0.0.0-alpha.1
```

If all looks good bump release.
```shell
> cargo release version 0.0.0-alpha.1 -x
```

Ensure Cargo dependencies are up-to-date.
```shell
> cargo update
```

Normal lint check and ensure openapi up-to-date.
```shell
> cargo xtask precommit
```

Commit (and sign) changes.
```shell
> git commit -S -a -m"chore: prepare release 0.0.0-alpha.1"
```

Push commit.
```shell
> git push upstream 0.0.0-alpha.1-prepare
```

### 3. Raise PR, pass CI, review and merge

Goto [github](https://github.com/trustification/trustify/pulls) and raise PR.

PR should pass CI. 

Get a friend to review.

On succesful review go ahead and merge!

### 4. Create release

Switch to main branch and make sure your local checkout is up-to-date.
```shell
> git switch main
> git fetch --all
> git rebase upstream/main
```

Create (signed) tag. 
```shell
> git tag -S v0.0.0-alpha.1
```

Push tag which triggers github release workflow. 
```shell
> git push upstream v0.0.0-alpha.1
```
Congratulations, the release is now building - [monitor](https://github.com/trustification/trustify/actions) the outcome! ðŸŽ‚

## If things go wrong

### Unaligned versions

If the current crate versions have already been released, then you need to bump the versions upfront.

### Broken stuff

Technically, it is possible to make changes to the tag and just force-push it again.

However, in most cases, it might be easier to accept defeat and try again with a new version.

## Test/personal release

To test, you can push a release tag to your personal fork of the repository. By default, this will run the release
workflow in your personal repository, and create a release there. If that's ok for your fork, you can push and force
push tags as you like, to fix and test the release process.
